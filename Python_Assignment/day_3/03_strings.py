# What is Typecasting and how do we use that in Python 
''' In Python, type casting refers to the process of converting a value of one data type (such as integer, string, float, etc.) into another data type.

To type cast a value in Python, you can use one of the following built-in functions:

int(): This function is used to convert a value to an integer data type. For example: int(3.14) will convert the value 3.14 to the integer 3.

float(): This function is used to convert a value to a floating-point data type. For example: float('3.14') will convert the string '3.14' to the floating-point value 3.14.

str(): This function is used to convert a value to a string data type. For example: str(3.14) will convert the value 3.14 to the string '3.14'.
